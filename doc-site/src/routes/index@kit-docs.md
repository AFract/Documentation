# Welcome to KitDocs

FastEndpoints for Fast APIs

This your home page. Feel free to change it to a Svelte file by renaming it
to `index@kit-docs.svelte`.

## Redirecting

You might want the home page to be the first page of your documentation. If this is the case,
rename this file to `index.svelte` and replace the content of this file with the following:

<img src="/code-sample.png" alt="Code Sample" />

</div>
