## In-Process Pub/Sub Notifications

If you'd like to take an event driven approach to building your application, you have the option to publish events from your endpoint handlers and have completely decoupled **event-handlers** to take action when events are published.

It's a simple 3 step process to do event driven work.

### 1. Define an Event Model/ DTO

This is the data contract that will be communicated across processes.

```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent
{
    public string OrderID { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public decimal OrderTotal { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Define an Event Handler

This is the code that will be fired/executed when events of the above DTO type gets published.

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : FastEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    public override Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var logger = Resolve<ILogger<OrderCreationHandler>>();
        logger.LogInformation($"order created event received:[{eventModel.OrderID}]");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### 3. Publish The Event

Simply hand in an event model/dto to the **PublishAsync()** method.

```cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/sales/orders/create");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CreateOrderRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var orderID = await orderRepo.CreateNewOrder(req);

        await PublishAsync(new OrderCreatedEvent
        {
            OrderID = orderID,
            CustomerName = req.Customer,
            OrderTotal = req.OrderValue
        });

        await SendOkAsync();
    }
}
```

## The PublishAsync() Method

The **PublishAsync()** method has an overload that will take a Mode enum that lets you specify whether to wait for **all subscribers** to finish; wait for **any subscriber** to finish; or wait for **none of the subscribers** to finish.

For example, you can publish an event in a fire-n-forget manner with the following:

```cs
await PublishAsync(eventModel, Mode.WaitForNone);
```

The default mode is **Mode.WaitForAll** which will await all subscribers. i.e. execution will only continue after each and every subscriber of the event has completed their work.

## Publishing From Event Handlers

It is also possible to publish events from within event handlers themselves like so:

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : FastEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    public override async Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await PublishAsync(new ReOrderLevelReachedEvent
        {
            ItemId = "ITM-0001",
            CurrentLevel = 5,
        });
    }
}
```

## Dependency Injection
Event handlers are used as singletons for [performance reasons](/benchmarks). I.e. there will only ever be one instance of an event handler type. You should not maintain state in event handlers. If you need to resolve scoped dependencies in your event handlers, you may do so as shown [here](dependency-injection#event-handler-dependencies).
