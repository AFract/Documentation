## In-Process Pub/Sub Notifications

If you'd like to take an event driven approach to building your application, you have the option to publish events from your endpoint handlers and have completely decoupled **event-handlers** to take action when events are published.

It's a simple 3 step process to do event driven work.

### 1. Define an Event Model/ DTO

This is the data contract that will be communicated across processes.

```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent
{
    public string OrderID { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public decimal OrderTotal { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Define an Event Handler

This is the code that will be fired/executed when events of the above DTO type gets published.

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : FastEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    public override Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var logger = Resolve<ILogger<OrderCreationHandler>>();
        logger.LogInformation($"order created event received:[{eventModel.OrderID}]");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### 3. Publish The Event

Simply hand in an event model/dto to the **PublishAsync()** method.

```cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Verbs(Http.POST);
        Routes("/sales/orders/create");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CreateOrderRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var orderID = await orderRepo.CreateNewOrder(req);

        await PublishAsync(new OrderCreatedEvent
        {
            OrderID = orderID,
            CustomerName = req.Customer,
            OrderTotal = req.OrderValue
        });

        await SendOkAsync();
    }
}
```

## The PublishAsync() Method

The **PublishAsync()** method has an overload that will take a Mode enum that lets you specify whether to wait for **all subscribers** to finish; wait for **any subscriber** to finish; or wait for **none of the subscribers** to finish.

For example, you can publish an event in a fire-n-forget manner with the following:

```cs
await PublishAsync(eventModel, Mode.WaitForNone);
```

The default mode is **Mode.WaitForAll** which will await all subscribers. i.e. execution will only continue after each and every subscriber of the event has completed their work.

## Publishing From Event Handlers

It is also possible to publish events from within event handlers themselves like so:

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : FastEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    public override async Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await PublishAsync(new ReOrderLevelReachedEvent
        {
            ItemId = "ITM-0001",
            CurrentLevel = 5,
        });
    }
}
```
